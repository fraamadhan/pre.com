            Hi, we know each other since Junior Highschool, i dont know why u wanna be my friend. at that time u have a boyfriend so i never thought i would love u. The feelings appeared suddenly, But i didnt have courage to confess, back then. Two years ago, I decided
            to confess, I try to assemble my bravery, then yes I confessed. I want to let u know that I've always been really glad I met u Seeing ur face would cheer me up a little and hearing ur voice would make my day. Meeting u was like listening to
            a song for the first time and knowing it would be my favourite. Let me be involved in your life, as a friend, besfriend, brother, father, daddy, grandpa, boyfriend, or husband hahaha. I love ur smile, which shines as if to say, "Everything's
            gonna be alright". So, keep fighting to reach your dream and get what u want the most. This is a pre-lamaran like I said hahaha, is this good? Anyway, thanks for accepting me as ur friend, you one of the best girl (u r not woman yet) in the
            world.
